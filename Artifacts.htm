This artifact is a good example of my skills/knowledge because it showcases my experience and knowledge about how to write a properly formatted business letter and also how to ergonomical so it may benefit me in the future in my job and in my health. This will help me move forward in the world of business if I decided to take a job in the field and will help me bring in more customers into our business with my skills of writing a well-formatted business letter. This would eventually help me and the company communicate better with everyone and would help bring in lots of investors and employers. Another thing about ergonomics is how it can help make you more productive and we can also use our knowledge on ergonomics to make our work environment safer for everyone so that you can work more comfortably knowing you can reduce the risk of something bad happening to you while working.

<br>
This artifact is a good example of my skills/knowledge because it outlines my knowledge and experience with the positives and negatives of the technology in the future as they revolutionize our futures in every way possible and imaginable. Knowing the pros and cons is an important skill needed for the future because it can either help our world become more advanced or it can send humanity downhill. Technology can accomplish a lot of things in our world if we can figure out the right way to use it. However, technology can also harm our world in serious ways. Some of these ways are already being used right now at this moment. A few examples of the pros would be (solving world peace, curing HLH, discovering anit-gravity, etc.) and some examples of the cons would be (increased cyberbullying, hacking, etc.) The future will always be uncertain for everyone, but if we can come together in unity and end all problems, we can save the planet and become one of these most advanced cvilizations in the galaxy and possibly the multi-verse. This assignment helps me practice the Catholic Social Teaching "A discerning believer" because we have to believe that humanity can come together in unity and can help technology come into the new age of civilization and can also reflect on their past actions so we do not make the same mistake twice.
