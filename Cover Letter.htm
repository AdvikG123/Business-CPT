Dear Mr. Mathews
<br>
<br>
As a Grade 9 student at St. Edmund Campion S.S, I have successfully passed the BTT course with one of the highest averages in my class and flying colors. I have acquired the skills in making a website, programming using HTML, how to work ergonmically for a better life in the future (etc.) I am writing this letter in regards to applying for the entry-level position at your dentistry clinic in order to manage your schedules and then hopefully to become an assitant during appointments.
<br>
<br>
With my skills and qualifications, I am more than capable of providing support and ideas in order to make your business even more successful. I have graduated from McMaster University with an Honors Degree. As a experienced Dental Assistant, I am very familiar with all the tools needed and even know how to operate the X-ray machine.
<br>
<br>
In contrast to my abilities, I frequently use my communication and empathy skills to connect with the patients on a deeper level to help them remain less stressful before their procedure and during. I have received many positive reviews from the patients that I had treated at the university and other clinics and can build easy relationships with everyone.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to reading your response soon about the next steps in this process. You may contact me by phone or email if you have any further questions or may want to discuss my qualities even further. I will be able to gladly help at any time needed or suited for you.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
<br>
Advik Girishankar
