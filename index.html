<i><p style="color:black ;">Hello, my name is Advik Girishankar and this is the beginning of my E-Portfolio. I am a 14 year old male. I was born in Bampton, Ontario, Canada. I have completed my elementary studies and now am about to finish my first year of high school here. My dream is to attend McMaster University for the Health Sciences Program in order to one day become a dentist or doctor. My biggest hobby to do outside is play basketball. I have been playing basketball since 9 years old and am very interested in the sport. Basketball is not a widely recognized sport and is not as popular as soccer or football. I believe that it should also be equal to those and should also be respected. My favorite basketball player is Stephen Curry because he is one of the most revelutionary players to ever exist. He calculates all his angles and the amount of ark he needs to put in order for it to score. I practice playing very often in order to one day play like him. I wish that I can fully complete all my education and one day come out and ready to face the challenges that life will throw at me.
